  "description": "jQuery-FontSpy.js works by checking the change in width of a string. Courier New is used as the font to compare against as it is one of the most widely distrubuted default fonts. Using a very large font-size, we are able to determine even the slightest change. When the width of the string changes, we know that the custom font-face file has been loaded and applied.",
